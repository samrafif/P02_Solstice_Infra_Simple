# Solstice Security - Safeguarding your inter-planetary infrastructure

We take the security of your data and systems seriously, no matter which planet they’re on.

1. **Multi-Planetary Data Encryption**: 
   All data is encrypted using 512-bit quantum-resistant encryption algorithms while in transit between planetary nodes. Rest assured, your data is secure even if it’s traveling from Mars to Europa.

2. **Redundant Planetary Backups**:
   Data is replicated across Earth, Mars, and Lunar archives, ensuring no single planetary event (or black hole) can lead to data loss.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring with SauronEye**:
   Our real-time monitoring system, SauronEye, provides 24/7 surveillance of your infrastructure, tracking anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, and potential cyber threats—no matter which celestial body they originate from.

4. **Incident Response**:
   Our incident response team is equipped to handle breaches on any planet. In the case of security incidents on non-Earth infrastructure, our Space Incident Response Unit (SIRU) deploys automated patches to all systems within seconds.

5. **SOC2 and HIPAA Compliance**:
   Solstice infrastructure is fully compliant with SOC2, HIPAA, and the Inter-Planetary Security Standards (IPSS), ensuring that we meet the highest standards for data security and privacy across all planetary locations.

6. **Security Audits**:
   Regular security audits are conducted for all planetary infrastructures using AI-driven analysis tools, ensuring our systems are fortified against both terrestrial and extraterrestrial threats.

7. **Physical Security**:
   All planetary data centers are guarded by both automated drones and on-site security teams. Access to these facilities is restricted via biometric scans and multi-factor authentication systems.

8. **Solar Flare and Radiation Protection**:
   All inter-planetary communication channels are shielded against solar flares and cosmic radiation, ensuring that data integrity is maintained during high-energy space events.
